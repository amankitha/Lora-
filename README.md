In Green Houses, precise environmental monitoring is crucial for optimizing crop yield
and quality. This project introduces a Lora-enabled greenhouse monitoring system
designed to enhance agricultural efficiency through wireless technology. The system
integrates sensors for UV light intensity, gas detection, temperature and humidity
(DHT11), soil moisture, and a motor for automated plant watering. The UV light sensor
ensures plants receive optimal light exposure, while the gas sensor monitors
environmental conditions for plant health. The DHT11 sensor tracks temperature and
humidity levels critical for plant growth. Soil moisture sensors provide real-time data on
soil conditions, enabling automated watering through a motorized system to maintain
optimal moisture levels.
Utilizing Lora technology, the system wirelessly transmits sensor data to a centralized
monitoring station. This enables real-time monitoring and remote management of
greenhouse parameters, empowering farmers to make informed decisions and optimize
resource allocation. Bypromoting sustainable agricultural practices, this project aims to
increase productivity and resilience in greenhouse cultivation environments.
